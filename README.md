The hostel management system project maintains and stores information regarding the students that are present in the hostel along with their room details and block numbers which meet the needs of the end user. This system allows both the users and admins to keep the track of all the rooms which are available in the hostel. A Hostel Management System with room booking, registration, and leave request functionality is a software application specifically designed to assist in the efficient management of hostels or similar accommodation facilities. It combines essential features related to room reservation, guest registration, and handling leave requests, enabling hostel administrators to streamline operations and enhance the overall experience for guests.
